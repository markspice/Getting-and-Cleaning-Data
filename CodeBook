PURPOSE:

The run_analysis.R process reads and summarises the test and training datasets of acceleration and angular velocity of 30 test subjects 
completing six activities collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. Further details on the 
makeup of the underlying datasets is available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

PROCESS:

•	Checks for existence of raw data in working directory and downloads and unzips if missing.
•	Combines raw data files into a single tidy data frame.
•	Removes any files added during the process.
•	Outputs the final data frame as a txt document.

CODE BOOK:

Factors:

•	subjectcode – Subject identification number [1:30]
•	activity – activity type (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS) corresponding to the 
             measurements
•	population – flag indicating whether the subject is in the test or train dataset

Summary measures:

66 summary statistics showing either the mean of the means or mean of the standard deviations of observations at the intersection of 
each subject and activity.

Column headers in the form of [signal][filtered signal][vector][domain]_[statistic]_[property]

•	signal – raw / jerk
•	filtered signal – body / gravity
•	vector – velocity / acceleration
•	domain – time / frequency
•	statistic – meanmean / meanstd
•	property – direction [X,Y,Z] / magnitude
